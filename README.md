## Cifra (Music Notation) Data Science Project

Cifras are popular music sheets for guitar players to learn songs. In Brazil, there are online forums where users share cifras of popular songs. We looked at [cifras.com.br](https://www.cifras.com.br/) and scraped some cifras from their forum following the web crawler instructions [robots.txt](https://www.cifras.com.br/robots.txt). 
**DISCLAIMER: scraped cifras have been collected solely for the purpose of personal research and self-study; the data will not be used for any commercial activities or purposes.**

This repository aims to showcase a complete data science project from data collection, cleaning, and filtering to data analysis and insights. The goal is to collect and analyze cifras to uncover patterns and insights that can assist musicians, especially self-taught guitar players, in understanding the mechanics of popular songs, such as common chord progressions, popular keys, and song structures. These findings can lead to the development of various products, from educational tools for guitar players to cifra generators.
